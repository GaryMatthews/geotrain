    <p>This software was mostly inspired by the <b>Geotrax</b> (Rail & Road System) toys from Fisher Price.
      So, you will find some tracks you are already familiar with, as well as new tracks.
      In fact, my idea is mostly to simulate "new" kind of tracks that I don't own or that doesn't exists in real life.
