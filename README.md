geotrain is a train layout designer / maker
by Fran√ßois CREVOLA

This software was mostly inspired by the Geotrax (Rail & Road System) toys from Fisher Price.

So, you will find some tracks you are already familiar with, as well as new tracks.
In fact, my idea is mostly to simulate "new" kind of tracks that I don't own or that doesn't exists in real life.
