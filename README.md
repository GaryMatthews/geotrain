# A train layout editor

Geotrain is a train layout designer / maker
by [François CREVOLA](https://github.com/Krevo)

This software was mostly inspired by the Geotrax (Rail & Road System) toys from Fisher Price.

So, you will find some tracks you are already familiar with, as well as new tracks.
In fact, my idea is mostly to simulate "new" kind of tracks that I don't own or that doesn't exists in real life.
